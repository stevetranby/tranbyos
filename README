===========
Tranby OS 
===========

Developing x86 simple operating system to learn the fundamentals of the boot process, device interaction, among other things ...

-------------------
Setup Environment
-------------------

Most linux distros will have binutils, make, gcc, and ld already installed.

 - binutils (standard )
 - make (build tool)
 - gcc (gnu compiler)
 - ld (linker)
 - nasm (assembler)
 - qemu (emulator)

--------------------
Build and Run
--------------------

make build
- Creates a binary kernel from assembling, compiling, and linking.

make disk
- Modifies standard GRUB disk image to include the kernel and configuration
- Creates the QEMU hard disk images

make run 
- Loads QEMU with GRUB disk image and hard disk images

---------------------
OS Details
---------------------

*Multiboot Header*
Using GRUB as the bootloader, since a bootloader is almost as much work as an OS kernel or more, I am using GRUB as suggested by many of the c/c++ kernel development guides.

*Simple Console Library*

*Interrupts and IRQs*
Currently these are mostly from Bran's Tutorial

*Keyboard Support*

*Timer Interrupt*
100Hz is the current interrupt frequency

*Simple Hard Disk ATA Driver*
Currently reads and writes data successfully.

_I'll write more as I have time to work on this_

Tips/Problems
=============
Prob: 
  undefined reference to '__stack_chk_fail'
Desc: 
  This problem occurs when the gcc compiler thinks you have a possible buffer
  overflow, or the code cannot be statically proven to be safe to such a bug.
Soln: 
  add -fno-stack-protector to the CFLAGS as an argument to gcc
